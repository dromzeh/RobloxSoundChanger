# Roblox Sound Changer

(I will fix this monstrosity one day, I wrote this incredibly sleep deprived, I'm so sorry)
- Windows program which allows for users to easily change their roblox death sound to any .ogg file of their choice.

## Installation

You can download a compiled version from releases or compile it yourself. I used VS2022.
